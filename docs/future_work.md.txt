# Future Work — Signature Generation & Verification System

This project demonstrates the use of a Vanilla GAN for synthetic signature generation
and its impact on reducing forgery acceptance in offline signature verification systems.

The following improvements are planned as future extensions:

## 1. Conditional GAN (CGAN)
Instead of generating generic signatures, a Conditional GAN can be used to generate
person-specific signatures by conditioning on user IDs or writer styles.
This will significantly improve verification performance for multi-user systems.

## 2. Higher Resolution Signatures
Current signatures are generated at 64×64 resolution.
Future versions can generate 128×128 or 256×256 images to capture finer stroke details,
which is important for forensic-level verification.

## 3. Advanced GAN Architectures
Replacing Vanilla GAN with DCGAN or StyleGAN variants can improve image quality,
reduce noise, and stabilize training.

## 4. Improved Verification Models
Using Siamese Networks with contrastive or triplet loss can better capture similarity
between genuine and forged signatures compared to simple binary classifiers.

## 5. Real-World Dataset Integration
Future work includes training and evaluation on standard datasets such as
GPDS, CEDAR, or MCYT to benchmark against academic literature.

## 6. Deployment in Production Systems
The system can be integrated into banking or e-governance pipelines with:
- REST APIs for signature verification
- Continuous monitoring of FAR/FRR
- Periodic retraining using newly collected signatures
